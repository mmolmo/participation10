      This font was created with the help of <strong>Metaflop</strong>, a custom font creation site. The visuals of the font are changed by adjusting a row located at the left side of the site with many sliders, which control various properties. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      For my font in particular, I chose to keep most of the settings the same as they were originally. Changes I made of note include <strong>pen width</strong>, which adjusts the line thickness of the typeface, <strong>unit width</strong>, which makes the letters slightly wider, some <strong>slanting</strong>, and a decreased <strong>taper</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      These properties combined together create a font that is clean, visually appealing, and simple.
